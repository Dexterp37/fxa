# shared-mozlog

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

This library is considered deprecated, and should only be used in scenarios where legacy code is in play. Using the logger implementation provided by libs/shared/log is now preferred.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test-unit shared-mozlog` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
