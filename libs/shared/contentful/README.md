# shared-contentful

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

It serves as a client for communicating with the Contentful GraphQL API, and supports strongly typed queries via codegen. See the codegen section for more information about how to manage typings.

## Building

Run `nx build shared-contentful` to build the library.

## GraphQL CodeGen

This library has a set of typings that are generated by GraphQL codegen. You can find them within `src/__generated__`. These types should not be modified manually, but rather updated via the codegen command present in this library.

You can update the generated types from the Nx GraphQL API via:

`nx run shared-contentful:codegen`

You will need to have both `CONTENTFUL_GRAPHQL_API_URL` and `CONTENTFUL_GRAPHQL_API_KEY` present within your .env file to run codegen.

Running codegen can be done at any time, though it's most important to do so after the Contentful schema has been updated, or when adding a new query/mutation to the project. Types for queries or mutations are automatically generated by the codegen client, so that they match the associated types from Contentful.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test shared-contentful` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
